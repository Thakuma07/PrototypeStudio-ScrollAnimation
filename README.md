## 🚀 Overview

Prototype Studio is a conceptual project designed to showcase selected creative works through a dynamic, responsive, and performance-optimized scroll-driven interface. It utilizes modern JavaScript libraries to ensure a buttery-smooth user experience while maintaining high visual fidelity.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Dynamic Project Indexing**: Real-time updating of the project counter (e.g., `01/10`) as you scroll.
- **Scroll-Triggered Image Reveal**: Images activate and reveal their full detail as they pass through the central spotlight area.
- **Smooth Content Panning**: Text and imagery move at different relative speeds to create a sense of depth and fluidity.
- **Full Smooth Scrolling**: Integration with Lenis for a consistent, premium feel across all devices.
- **Mobile Responsive**: Carefully crafted layouts that adapt seamlessly to smaller screens.
- **High Performance**: Optimized GSAP animations with proper use of `will-change` for hardware acceleration.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **HTML5/CSS3**: Semantic structure and modern CSS (clamp, flexbox, grid).
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**: The industry standard for high-performance web animations.
- **ScrollTrigger**: GSAP plugin for advanced scroll-driven animations.
- **Lenis**: For state-of-the-art smooth scrolling experience.
